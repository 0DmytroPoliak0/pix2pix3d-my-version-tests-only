    Integration test simulating Musaâ€™s operational profiles.
    
    Steps:
    1. Define an operational profile for seg2cat by assigning weights
       to different random seeds (simulate different usage frequencies).
    2. For each seed, run the generate_samples.py script to generate images.
    3. Compute quality metrics:
         - IoU between generated segmentation and input segmentation.
         - SSIM between generated color image (converted to grayscale) and input segmentation (as a proxy).
    4. Compute an overall quality score for each seed.
    5. Compute the weighted average quality score based on the operational profile.
    6. Print out the scores and assert that the weighted quality score is above a threshold.
    
    Expected Result:
      The weighted quality score should be above a predefined threshold (e.g., 60/100)
      to indicate that, under realistic usage conditions, the model produces acceptable outputs.
